# Reactive Fields

This application tries to implement Reorderable list view and Dismissible list simulateously. The list of items can support different widgets all together.

## Demo

Here we used only two different widgets that were `MyTitleField` and `MyContentField`. Which both extends StatefullWidget. You can use many other widgets also.
